This project contains a complete sample application for the book [Mastering Software Testing with JUnit 5]. It consists on a web application in which end uses can rate a list of cats by watching its name and picture. The rate shall be done once per end user using a star mechanism. Optionally, comments can be made per cat. This application has been built using the following technologies:

* Spring Framework, as application framework: Spring Boot, Spring MVC + Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Test (for integration tests).
* JUnit 5, as testing framework.
* Hamcrest, for improving the readability of assertions.
* Mockito, for unit testing.
* Selenium WebDriver, for end-to-end testing.

The screenshots below show the application GUI in action.
